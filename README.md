# Yew Snippets

This is a small collection of snippets I threw together to speed up working with [yew](https://yew.rs/) in Neovim.

## Installation
### Neovim
You'll need a completion engine and a snippet engine. I'm using (nvim-cmp)[https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp] and (vim-vsnip)[https://github.com/hrsh7th/vim-vsnip] (respectively). Add the contents of `yew_snippets.json` to your vsnip path (`~/.vsnip` by default). After that, the snippets should just work by typing the `prefix` defined in the json file

### VSCode
I haven't tried setting this up with VSCode but I think you should be able to use this same json file with Code by following [these instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets#_create-your-own-snippets). If you figure it out, feel free to open a PR to update this readme.

## Contributing
Please submit any additional snippets you'd like to add via a PR and I'll merge it.
